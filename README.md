## Hi there...

Welcome to the very begining of learning more about me

I am Kafui, a Software Developer working as a Developer Advocate at Cradx on Python related projects, where I get to speak about company products and contribute to internal tooling and custom applications for our clients.

I am also a DSF Individual member, I contribute to Open Source community both locally (PyHo as the Lead/Organizer) and internationally (PyCascades as the Remote Chair). I'm a long time volunteer coach/organizer of Django Girls Ho and several other Django Girls workshops I have volunteered as a coach and co-organized.
